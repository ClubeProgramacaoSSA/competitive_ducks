## About ü§î:

Hellow Ducks ü¶Ü! Welcome to our GitHub repository dedicated to storing and organizing all the valuable resources related to competitive programming and general programming. This initiative is led by the students of SENAI CIMATEC, aiming to support fellow students and enthusiasts in their journey of learning and preparing for coding marathons.

Our goal is to create a centralized hub where all the study materials, problem sets, tutorials, and tips can be accessed and shared among our community. By collaborating on this repository, we aim to foster a culture of learning, mentorship, and continuous improvement.

## Dependencies üöö:

The project dependencies are described in  ```./dependencies/requirements.``` within the repository. In summary, heres what you're gonna need in order to run the project:

- [```dependencie <version>```](http:link.com).
- 

For installing dependencies more quickly, you can run the following command at terminal, inside the clonned repository:

	sudo apt update && sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
    pip3 install -r ./dependencies/requirements.txt

Make sure you have all Dependencies before running the project.

## How to run these codes üèÉ:

First, clone this repository. In the top of each code file, has a manual with instructions for compiling, running, its porpouse and other information. They usually look like the template below:

	/*
	File:           file_name.ext
	Last changed:   xx/xx/20xx xx:xx
	Purpose:        Code for hard problems         
	Authors:        Fernando Ant√¥nio Marques Schettini   
	Usage: 
		HowToCompile:   gcc fiLe_name.cpp -o file_name
		HowToExecute:   ./file_name           
	*/ 

## Development Process ‚öôÔ∏è:

This material is created without a specific methodology, with members of the programming club helping to develop the material as their studies progress. It's important to note that during hackathons, this repository is frequently updated.

### Tools Used üõ†Ô∏è: 

- [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org). 
- [VIM](https://www.vim.org).
- [python3](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/).

For installing some tools more quickly, you can run the following command at terminal, inside the clonned repository:

    sh ./dependencies/install_tools.sh
	
## How to contribute ü´Ç:


Feel free to create a new branch, fork the project, create a new Issue or make a pull request contact one of us to contribute at this competitive programming materials. We encourage all students and coding enthusiasts to contribute to this repository. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced programmer, your contributions are valuable to us. Here are a few ways you can contribute:

- Sharing Study Materials: Have you come across a useful textbook, online course, or tutorial? Share it with the community by adding it to the appropriate folder within the repository.

- Adding Problem Solutions: If you have solved interesting coding problems from coding platforms or competitions, feel free to contribute your solutions. Include clear explanations and optimal code implementations to help others understand and learn from your solutions.

- Creating Tutorials: Do you have expertise in a particular algorithm, data structure, or programming language? Consider creating a tutorial or guide to help others grasp complex concepts more easily. Your tutorials can greatly benefit beginners and intermediate-level programmers.

- Supporting Others: One of the core principles of our community is to help each other grow. Engage in discussions, provide feedback on code submissions, and offer guidance to those who are just starting their coding journey. Together, we can build a supportive environment for everyone involved.
